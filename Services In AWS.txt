CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is a way to access computing services on-demand, such as storage, servers, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet.
It allows users to rent computing services instead of buying them, and pay for what they use. 

Advantages
- Cost Efficient
- Services are hosted virtually
- Security
- Pay as you go model

SERVICE MODEL

On-Premises

1. Application : Software Program
2. Data : Collection of stored databases or information
3. Runtime : Execution Environment
4. Middleware : It is a software which acts as bridge or intermediatory b/w different applications or systems
5. OS : It is the interface b/w user and applications.It is a collection of programs which acts as mediator b/w harware and software.
6. Virtualization : Virtual version of something such as OS, storage, network resources.
7. Server : A server is a computer or system i.e manage,store,distribute network resources. Servers are typically powerful machines that have a large amounts of memory,
            storage and processing power and are designed to handle multiple request.
8. Storage : It is used to store the information or data such as files, documents, images, videos etc
9. Network : It is used to communicate b/w 2 or more devices.

Types of Services

IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service)

From Virtualization to network
Ex: EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute

PAAS( Platform as a Service)

It is complete development and deployment environment in cloud from runtime to network.
Ex : Elastic Bean Stalk

SAAS(Software as a Service)

Allows users to connect to and use cloud based apps over the internet.

Reasons for migrating from On-Premises to Cloud?

-Cost
-High Security
-More Feature
-Scalability
-Taken care by AWS
-Maintance is done by Cloud

AWS is Global Infrastructure - They have Data Centers everywhere

- Regions
- Availabilty Zones

AWS provides Global Infrastructure because to provide high speed, low latency, which enables clients to access AWS services without any issues.

Regions : Data center which is the physical location where we can find cluster of Availability Zone.
AZ : Clusters of Data Centers, each AZ will be connected using internal network, each AZ will be situated within 100km
     Each Region has many AZ  MIN : 2 AZ  MAX : 6 AZ in North Virginia
                                          1. High Availability
                                          2. All the new Features are updated in this region.

VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (VPC)

- Regional service
- Virtual and dedicated network for your AWS account.
- Network VPC = Owned by us
- Using this dedicated network we can run resources 
- Control who can access these resources (who can come inside and go outside)
- By default we can create 5 VPC's
- By default one VPC cannot talk to another VPC (Because it is an isolated network)\

SUBNET : Dividing the big network into smaller network OR the range of IP Address in VPC.

CIDR : CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, a method for allocating IP addresses that improves the efficiency of data routing on the internet.

Main Route Table : It is storing alln the best path information from source to destination.

(PING is a tool to check the connectivity)

VPC PEERING

- It establishes secure connection b/w two VPC's
- To enable communication b/w 2 VPC's we establish peering connection
- Peering is possible for
    1. same region
    2. cross region
    3. cross account

Going from VPC A to VPC B

1. VPC A is requestor.
2. VPC B is acceptor.
3. No same CIDR range.
4. Take different CIDR range.
5. It is a 2 way communication.
6. Edit route table of A and B because if VPC A wants to communicate with VPC B.

TRANSIT GATEWAY

- It is used to attach one or more VPC's.

Attachment: The connection from AMAZON VPC
Association: The route table used to route packets coming from an attachment
Propagation: The route tables where the attachments are installed.

EC2 (ELASTIC CLOUD COMPUTE)

- It is a level at which system ia able to adapt to workload changes by provisioning and deprovisioning the resources.
- Amazon is a virtual server for running applications on EC2.
  1. Scalable
  2. Cost efficient.
- Amazon is the most popular AWS offering.
- It is a IAAS

EC2 Instance Types

1. General Purpose
